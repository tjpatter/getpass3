getpass - Universal Password Retrieval Utility - Version 3.0 - 03/11/2022

This program retrieves a user's eDirectory Universal Password by using an LDAP extended operation.

To install, simply ensure you have a Python 3 environment with the 'argparse', 'ldap3' and 'sys' modules available.
This code will run on any system that meets these requirements, Linux, Mac, and Windows.

Example installation on Open Enterprise Server 2018 SP3 (x86_64) / SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP5 (x86_64),
run as root:

python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade
pip3 install ldap3

Usage (at a shell type):
:~> python3 getpass.py

The following arguments are required:
-u/--admin-user, CN of an administrative user, ex: cn=admin,o=lab
-p/--admin-pass, Password for the administrative user
-s/--server-host, Hostname of the target server. ex: oes.lab.local
-P/--server-port, TLS port of the target server. ex: 636
-t/--target-user, CN of the target user password you want to retrieve. ex: cn=test,ou=users,o=lab

Example output:
oes:~> python3 getpass.py -u cn=admin,o=lab -p Mylabpass -s oes.lab.local -P 636 -t cn=test,ou=users,o=lab
SuperSecret!


NOTE: The eDirectory environment must be using the Universal Password feature, and the target user must have a Universal Password Policy assigned to them by using iManager. The Password Policy must also allow the administrative user to retrieve passwords.
